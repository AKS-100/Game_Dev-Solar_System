🌌 Solar System Simulator
A 3D Solar System simulation built in Unity 6 (Unity 6.3 LTS) that visually demonstrates planetary rotation and orbiting mechanics in real time.
This project recreates the Sun and planets with realistic motion behavior using C# scripts and Unity’s transform system.

🚀 Features:
☀️ Rotating Sun
🌍 Planets orbiting around the Sun
🔄 Real-time rotation and revolution mechanics
🎥 Camera control system
🌌 Space skybox environment
🎵 Background ambient space audio
